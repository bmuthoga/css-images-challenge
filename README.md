### Challenge #2 - Animated Koala
This is the animated version of [this](https://github.com/bmuthoga/css-images-challenge/tree/koala-css-image) CSS image. I've kept the animations simple for this one.

I used [this](https://codepen.io/bfred-it/pen/RNGOQW) codepen by [bfred-it](https://codepen.io/bfred-it) as a reference for animating the eyes and borrowed the idea of twitching the nose from [this](https://codepen.io/zastrow/pen/kLeDa) codepen by [Philip Zastrow](https://codepen.io/zastrow).

Here's how the animated CSS image looks like:
