# css-images-challenge
This repository contains a collection of images drawn using CSS. The main goal was to level up my skills in CSS as well as my creativity in web design which is paramount to front-end web development.

Most of the images are developed using only CSS and HTML, but some animations may include Javascript, although I've tried to keep their complexity to a minimum. 

This repository is open to all with the intention of helping others learn something new. Each image is on its own separate branch and you can find the links to the various sources and guides that I came across while learning on the respective image's branch. Do follow the links as they contain more detailed info whereas this repository only contains the final product. 

If you find anything amiss, such as credit to your work, or even want to issue a takedown request of references to your work, feel free to ping me via [email](mailto:bmuthoga@gmail.com)
