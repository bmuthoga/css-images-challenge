### Challenge #1 - Koala
This is the first CSS image that I drew with the help of a very simple and easy to understand guide by [Michael Mangialardi](https://medium.com/coding-artist/a-beginners-guide-to-pure-css-images-ef9a5d069dd2), a UI developer, over at Medium. 

I recommend the platform for other tutorials as well as I find they're guides simple enough to get started off and at most they can take is 20 minutes of your time. Also do follow [Michael Mangialardi](https://medium.com/coding-artist/a-beginners-guide-to-pure-css-images-ef9a5d069dd2) as he has other amazing articles such as [React.js for the Visual Learner](https://medium.com/coding-artist/react-js-for-the-visual-learner-chapter-1-what-is-this-all-about-a0d28cfd33c6) and [Redux from Scratch](https://medium.com/coding-artist/practical-redux-chapter-1-core-concepts-f5a53f74505c).

Below is how the final CSS image looks like. I will later add some animation to it, really looking forward to that.
