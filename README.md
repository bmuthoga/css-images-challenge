### Challenge #3 - Animated Mustache
I was motivated to build this mustache after watching [one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0_FMCji3iE&t=1s) of the [dotCSS Conference](https://www.dotcss.io/) videos which featured [Wenting Zhang's](https://twitter.com/DesignJokes) demonstration on building animated CSS using only one `div`. This is where it all started for me. She made CSS seem super easy which motivated me to learn more. 

She's also come up with a number of really good animated CSS icons that you can check out [here](https://cssicon.space/).

Here's how the animated CSS image looks like:
